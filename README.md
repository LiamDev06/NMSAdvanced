# NMSAdvanced
This repository includes a variety of features and creations relating to NMS plugin development. A majority of the repo is code I have written while watching [MineAcademy's NMSAdvanced course](https://mineacademy.org/nms-advanced).

## Information
The **NMSAdvanced** repository is a Spigot 1.8.8 plugin including everything from particles, animations, commands, NPCs, NBT data, GUIs and much more. As I build onto this project, I will keep updating the features section down below. The plugin does not serve any direct purpose - it is a general collection of things I have built that requires the use of NMS during my journey of learning the advanced parts of plugin development.

## Features
- Commands
  - `/directping` - get the users ping by accessing NMS directly
  - `/reflectionping` - get the users ping by accessing NMS using reflection
